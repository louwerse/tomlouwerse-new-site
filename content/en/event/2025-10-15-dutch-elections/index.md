# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "The Dutch parliamentary elections present a challenge for Dutch and international students and staff alike: to navigate their way through the many parties, politicians, and issues in a highly fragmented political landscape. What issues are central in the campaign, and what are the parties’ positions on these issues? How does the early termination of the Schoof cabinet feed into the campaign? How do Dutch voters make sense of opinion polls, voting advice applications, and the practice of calculating the socio-economic effects of party manifestos?

To help Dutch and international students and staff make sense of the Dutch elections, the cluster ‘Politics in the Netherlands’ is organising a panel discussion, featuring Sarah de Lange, Tom Louwerse, and Simon Otjes (all Leiden University). They will provide an introduction to key issues, parties and public opinion, and answer all questions that you might have related to the upcoming Dutch elections. The session will be moderated by Denny van der Vlist (Leiden University)."
