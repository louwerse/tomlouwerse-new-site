summary: ""
abstract: I contributed to the workshop on 'Formal Institutions' hosted by Wouter Veenendaal by talking about the role of opposition parties and the extent to which they fulfil their roles. Using data from our project 'Who opposes' we showed the level of distinctiveness of opposition parties in four democracies over the last 70 years.
