### Career

I studied political science at Leiden University, obtaining my Master's degree (cum laude) in 2006 and my PhD in 2011. Part of my PhD research was completed at the University of Nottingham, where I was a guest PhD researcher in 2008. My PhD thesis, written under supervision of Prof. Rudy Andeweg and Dr Huib Pellikaan deals with the the democratic mandate of political parties in Great Britain and the Netherlands. This dissertation was shortlisted for the ECPR Jean Blondel Prize.

After I completed my dissertation, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Political Legitimacy research profile area at Leiden, a multi-disciplinary project involving history, law, political science and public administration. In addition, I taught at the Institute of Political Science.

From September 2013 to December 2015 I held the position of Assistant Professor in Political Science at [Trinity College Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/), Ireland. My responsibilities included teaching courses in research methods and statistics as well as comparative politics. I was Director of the M.Sc. in Politics & Public Policy in 2014-2015. In January 2016 I took up the position of Assistant Professor of Political Science at Leiden University.

### Current position

In 2019 I was promoted to Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Leiden University. I teach comparative politics, Dutch politics, research methods and statistics.

Beside my regular academic work (research and teaching), I am Director of Research at the Institute of Political Science. As a member of the Institute Board, I am responsible for policy regarding all matters relating to research conducted at our Institute.

#### Professional service and outreach

I fulfil various professional service roles. I am a member of the [Young Academy Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/academic-staff/young-academy-leiden), an interdisciplinary group of young academics at Leiden University. I acted as its chair from January 2019 to August 2020. I am a board member of Leiden University's [Centre for Dutch Politics and Governance](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/cnpb) and the [Centre for the Study of Political Parties and Representation](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/csppr).

Between 2015 and 2021, I was a member and later chair of the steering committee of the [Standing Group on Parliaments](http://standinggroups.ecpr.eu/parliaments/), one of the largest and most active specialist groups within the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR). In 2017 and 2018, I co-organized the Dutch Flemish Political Science conference [*Politicologenetmaal*](http://politicologenetmaal.eu/) with Hans Vollaard, Corinna Jentzsch and Nicolas Blarel in Leiden. In 2019, I co-organized the [Standing Group on Parliaments Conference](http://standinggroups.ecpr.eu/parliaments/?page_id=499) in Leiden with Rudy Andeweg, Tim Mickler and Cynthia van Vonno.

My outreach activities include polling aggregation in the [Netherlands](http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl/), published by the public broadcaster NOS, and [Ireland](http://www.pollingindicator.com/) (together with Stefan MÃ¼ller). I am a co-founder and co-editor of the Dutch political science weblog [Stuk Rood Vlees](http://www.stukroodvlees.nl/).

#### Honours and grants

In September 2015 I received the [Emerging Scholars Award](http://www.apsanet.org/section-5-Emerging-Scholars-Award) from the Organized Section on Political Organizations and Parties of the American Political Science Association. I was selected as a member of [Young Academy Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/academic-staff/young-academy-leiden) in 2019.

My work is financially supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). In 2018, together with Prof. Thomas Zittel and Prof. Rosie Campbell, I obtained a grant in the Open Research Area (ORA) for your project ["The Nature of Political Representation in Times of Dealignment"]({{< ref "/project/napre/index.md" >}}), which concluded in 2022. In 2019, I was awarded an NWO Vidi grant for my research project ["Who opposes? Explaining government-opposition cooperation in parliament and its consequences for democratic legitimacy"](project/who-opposes).
