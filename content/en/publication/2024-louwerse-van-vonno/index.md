  A key political arena in Dutch politics is its bicameral parliament. In comparative terms it is relatively powerful, but in practice governing party MPs generally loyally support the government. Political parties are key in shaping parliamentary behaviour, parliament is highlight fragmented, and there is a high level of policy specialization of MPs. This chapter outlines the key characteristics of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the Netherlands, including their powers and parliamentary behaviour. Subsequently, three major lines of legislative research in the Netherlands are discussed: ‘macro perspectives’ focussing on parliamentary history and executive-legislative relations, ‘meso-level research’ that looks at what happens in the plenary and parliamentary committees, and the ‘micro-level’ of individual MPs’ role orientations and careers. Suggestions for a research agenda include the combination of research traditions and the use of novel data and data analysis techniques.
